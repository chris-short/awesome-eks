== What is EKS

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS without needing to install, operate, and maintain your own Kubernetes control plane or nodes. Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

== Justification

@ramitsurana has already done a great job at curating a thorough list of
https://github.com/ramitsurana/awesome-kubernetes[Awesome Kubernetes] with EKS
it includes some subtle differences since you cannot run anything on top of the
managed masters. This means things like the dashboard need to be customized to
run without a stitch.
