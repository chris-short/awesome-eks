A curated list for awesome EKS resources

== What is EKS

Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) is Amazon Web Services' (AWS)
managed Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to simply create a managed `etcd` and
master infrastructure connecting into your AWS account for the worker nodes.

== Justification

@ramitsurana has already done a great job at curating a thorough list of
https://github.com/ramitsurana/awesome-kubernetes[Awesome Kubernetes] with EKS
it includes some subtle differences since you cannot run anything on top of the
managed masters. This means things like the dashboard need to be customized to
run without a stitch.
